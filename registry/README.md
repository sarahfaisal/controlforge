# Registry (config-first)

This folder is the **source of truth** for what the workbench can discover without code changes.

- `taxonomy/` — Industries → segments → use cases
- `packs/` — Versioned security/safety/governance packs
- `suggestions/` — Optional patterns/tools/templates

Add folders/files here and the API will pick them up at runtime.
